This is an old demo project for adding pseudo-intelligent 3D depth to a flat webcam feed.

A matrix of small cubes is assembled and coloured to match corresponding pixels from BitmapData frames captured from the user's webcam. These are then displaced along the z axis based on the average brightness of the pixel.

[Tidied up and put online due to recent interest.]
